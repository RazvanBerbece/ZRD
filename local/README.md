# Local
Files here will be generated by the ZRD client and stored locally on a node.

These can include :
1. Blockchain data (blocks, unvalidated transactions, etc..)
2. User wallet data (stored once user creates wallet on ZRD) - **this needs further consideration to avoid deletion of local data, or maybe wallet recovery ?**
3. Other metadata
